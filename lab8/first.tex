	\section{Introduction}The wide-scale adoption of driverless cars or autonomous vehicles (AVs) will lead to unprecedented economic, social and environmental change. For the public, the independence and freedom of personal travel will be available to almost everyone – youth, seniors and the physically, mentally and visually impaired. The expected reduction of road congestion would bring wide-ranging work and personal benefits. The gains from a drop in vehicle accidents and deaths are obvious.
	
	
	\subsection{Assisted driving}
	With each model year, new driver-assist functions become options or standard features and no longer just available on premium models. This gradually moves the driving public from being actively ‘in the driver’s seat’, to a new era where we are passengers being driven around by fully automated cars.
	
	
	
	\subsection{Self-driving}
	Several technology companies are working on creating vehicles capable of navigating themselves through mixed traffic conditions on all roads and highways.
